        <h1>Extracurriculars</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">I have done robotics since fourth grade (excluding Covid years). I started with FLL (First LEGO Leage) in elementary and middle school where I learned the basics of building a robot with LEGOs and coding it to accomplish missions. In high school, I was part of VEX team 9421H from Framingham High School. In VEX, I learned much more about the technical pieces that we used to make much larger robots that we operated to complete challenges. We competed for two years making it to the regionals the first year and World Championship the second year. I had to leave my VEX robotics team when I joined Mass Academy. At Mass Academy, I am part of First Team 190 through WPI and Mass Academy. The competition season has just begun, but I have already learned many skills such as making parts in the shop. I am looking forward to working with my team and competing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Other than robotics, I took part in the debate team at my sending school, and also founded the Computer Science club. At Mass Academy, I am part of the math team, and took another extracurricular activity where we learned about circuits, Arduino, and how things worked. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am also a second degree black belt working towards my third degree black belt. I am a certified karate instructor and also teach junior belts at the local YMCA. </p>
