        <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>

        <div class="headText">
            <p class="paragraph">In computer science, we learn programming languages such as HTML and Java. In HTML, we constructed and published our individual websites. In Java, we created small programs to complete a variety of tasks, such as calculating salaries with user input of hours worked and hourly salary. Since I have previously taken APCS and also have experience with other programming languages, I am in the advanced CS group where we are working on a larger project. As in the past I have created numerous mini-games, I decided to challenge myself and make a larger, complex game for my project. The project is still under development, but you can read more about it below! </p>

            <p class="description">One assignment was a decisions exercise, where we had to complete a variety of challenges using branching mechanisms like if and else commands. This assignment had different parts which took in user input, did different calculations depending on what was entered, and then outputted a response. </p>

            <p class="floatl">My computer science project is a large, complex point and click game. This has been a fun and challenging project as I have learned many new coding skills. For example, I made a navigation system that allows the user to move between the 'Home page', 'How page', and 'Level select pages'. I also made a scrolling feature which is not a built-in in feature in any of the JavaScript libraries I am using. To add these features, I had to improvise on my programming skills by using the tools in different ways.</p>
