        <h1>Community Service</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">Since 2016, I have been volunteering with a group from the New England Sikh Study Circle by manning a table at the Jimmy Fund Walk. It is inspiring to see people of all ages walking together towards a common cause. Another place I help at is a Place to Turn, which is a local food pantry. Along with raising funds, making announcements, and helping buy groceries I help organize and plan the trips. We also spend time at the pantry sorting canned and boxed food by their expiry date. Being able to give back to the community gives me a sense of satisfaction. My dad has been organizing quarterly visits to St. Francis Homeless Shelter for over 30 years and I have been going there since I was a baby, learning humility and how to serve others. Every quarter we prepare care packages that include the basic toiletries and hand them out personally. During Thanksgiving we hand out sweatshirts, gloves, and hats. Having gone through Sunday School for the last 10 years, I have learnt the rich tenets of the Sikh religion, its core values and am proud to be an American Sikh. In an effort to give back to my community, I decided to become a teacher's assistant for core classes. As a Teacherâ€™s Assistant at the New England Sikh Study Circle, I work closely with elementary and middle school kids teaching them Gurmukhi (Punjabi) and Sikh History. Through traditional lessons, Jeopardy, and kahoots, I continue to both teach and learn from the kids in an engaging and interactive manner.</p>
