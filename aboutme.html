                My name is Hartej Anand, and I am a junior at Mass Academy. I enjoy computer science and robotics, especially the intersection of the two. I also really like dinosaurs! Like most kids, I enjoy playing video games, and that is how I actually got into coding, since I realized that I could code my own games! In my free time, I usually code, do karate, build LEGOs, or play video games. My favorite game is <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a>, and my favorite movies are <i>Star Wars</i> (especially the original movies), <i>Back to the Future</i>, and <i>G-Force</i>. 
                <br><br>
                I enjoy spending time with my family and traveling to places. We have fun together exploring new places and seeing new things. I also enjoy learning new things about topics such as space, animals, or other <i>National Geographic</i> documentaries. Recently, I have been learning more coding and tech-based topics, but still enjoy these other topics. 
                <br><br>
                I have been coding for about three years, and know a few languages (mostly Java, Javascript, and HTML/CSS). I started on <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_718233252969952158251569/projects">Khan Academy</a> where I made small games with Javascript. I also learnt some other languages through other platforms, but mostly stick to JS. I plan on learning more so that I can create more complex games and apps. Other than coding, I have also been doing karate for a long time (about 10 years). I am currently a black belt and also teach younger belts. I used to also ski and play basketball, but since COVID, I have not resumed those sports.
