            <p class="paragraph">During Spanish class, we only speak Spanish during the entire duration of the class. We often watch Spanish videos in class, and are making our own movie in Spanish. Additionally, we also get to do many fun and unique activities to practice, such as playing board games in Spanish, and making memes.</p>

            <p class="description">We had to write an essay in Spanish describing a trip we once went on. We wrote this essay in the beginning of the year, but since then we have not done many writing assignments such as essays due to the more project-based learning curriculum.</p>

            <p class="floatl">The memes we made were in Spanish. This was a fun assignment as we had to make memes that related to Mass Academy, and is also fun to see as more peoples' memes are placed on the board, and to see others work. Since language is both French and Spanish, it is also fun to try to translate a French meme based on context clues, and see how correct you were.</p>
