            <p class="description">One lab we did was when we got to create our own lab. We had to choose a topic that was related to the topic we were learning. My group decided to focus on proving that there is no correlation between surface area and the coefficient of friction. This was fun as it was something that we were told about, but normally you do not have an opportunity to prove it through your own experimentation. During the lab, we were able to prove this.</p>

            <p class="description">This physics lab was testing acceleration down a slope. We tested different cases, and this allowed us to see what we were learning. I found this extremely useful as it helped me understand the concepts rather than just hearing about it. </p>
